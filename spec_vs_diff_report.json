  "summary": "The diff implements all three requirements (REQ-1, REQ-2, REQ-3) with good coverage. REQ-1 is addressed via useLandscapeOrientation hook usage in SpaceSnakeScreen and game loop pausing in useSpaceSnakeGame. REQ-2 is addressed via the new useTiltControls hook with deadzone, gamma axis mapping, iOS permission handling, and integration into useSpaceSnakeGame. REQ-3 is addressed via the new SpaceSnakeTiltToggle component with localStorage persistence. One minor gap exists: the tilt precedence logic in useSpaceSnakeGame always prefers tilt over joystick when tilt is active, rather than using 'most recently active' precedence as specified.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "The tilt control should work alongside the existing virtual joystick — whichever input is active most recently takes precedence.",
      "reason": "In useSpaceSnakeGame.ts, the logic always gives tilt priority when tiltEnabled and tiltAngle is non-null, rather than tracking which input was most recently used and giving that input precedence. There is no timestamp or recency tracking between tilt and joystick inputs.",
