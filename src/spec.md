# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Update Snake gameplay presentation to match the reference screenshots by showing more open arena space, reducing UI clutter, and using a cleaner blue arena theme.

**Planned changes:**
- Zoom the gameplay camera out so more arena space is visible around the snake while keeping rendering crisp (no stretching) across device pixel ratios.
- Adjust the gameplay UI layout to keep HUD/controls compact and anchored to edges/corners, avoiding heavy frames/borders that visually shrink the playfield.
- Update the gameplay visual theme toward a mostly-uniform blue arena with subtle texture and lightweight, consistent UI styling.

**User-visible outcome:** During Snake gameplay, the snake appears smaller with noticeably more empty blue arena visible, and the HUD feels cleaner and stays out of the center play area on both mobile and desktop.
