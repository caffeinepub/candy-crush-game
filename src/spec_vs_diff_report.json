  "summary": "REQ-2 appears implemented via a more robust, DPR-aware `useCanvasViewport` and corresponding crisp canvas backing-store sizing in `SnakeCanvas`. REQ-1 likely implemented in CSS, but the diff excerpt is truncated and does not explicitly show rules targeting `.game-container.snake-game-container`, so full compliance can’t be conclusively verified from the provided snippet. Several changes introduce new theming/visual assets beyond the requested resizing scope.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Update responsive sizing rules for the main gameplay container (element with classes `game-container snake-game-container`) to make it medium-sized on desktop/tablet while fitting fully within the viewport, stable on mobile, maintaining 16:9.",
      "reason": "The provided `frontend/src/index.css` diff is truncated before any explicit rules referencing `.game-container.snake-game-container` are shown. While the file summary claims responsive medium-sized container behavior, the actual diff evidence provided does not conclusively show the required class-targeted sizing rules or the specific breakpoint behavior.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/index.css (truncated)",
        "frontend-file-summaries.txt (mentions responsive medium-sized Snake Arena container, but not the actual CSS rules)"
