  "summary": "The diff implements a zoomed-out gameplay camera via a reduced zoom constant and canvas rendering that accounts for DPR, and it introduces a blue-themed visual style and compact HUD/overlay components. Based on the truncated CSS, edge-anchored/low-clutter layout appears intended, but exact positioning/heaviness of frames cannot be fully verified from the provided diff excerpts.",
