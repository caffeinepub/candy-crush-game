  "summary": "REQ-3 appears implemented by removing the standalone right-side coin HUD panel from SnakeHUD and related styling. REQ-1 is partially evidenced (join code state/validation and join handler exist), but the diff truncation prevents confirming the actual Multiplayer tab UI elements (input + Join button) are rendered. REQ-2 adds a Room Code panel component with copy-to-clipboard feedback, but there is no evidence it is actually rendered during multiplayer gameplay.",

      "reason": "A MultiplayerRoomCodePanel component with copy feedback is added, but the diff summary does not show it being imported/used in the in-game multiplayer HUD/gameplay screen, so persistence/visibility during gameplay cannot be confirmed.",
