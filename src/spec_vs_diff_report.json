  "summary": "Diff implements a new Hill Climb Photo Gallery screen with navigation from the main menu, adds localStorage persistence for unlocked photos (defaulting photo-1 to unlocked), integrates photo unlocking with coin balance deduction, updates drive controls to use pointer capture/cancel handling for reliable mobile input, and updates asset mappings + service worker cache list for the gallery images. However, the diff does not explicitly include the actual static image files under frontend/public/assets/generated.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-5",
      "requirement": "Add the provided photos as curated static gallery assets under frontend/public/assets/generated and reference them by URL from the frontend.",
      "reason": "The diff updates asset URL mappings and service worker cache list to include the gallery photo paths, but it does not show any added static image files in frontend/public/assets/generated. Without the actual files, the gallery would reference paths that may not exist.",

        "frontend/public/sw.js",
        "File diff summary shows only 1 added file (a TSX screen) and no added PNG assets under frontend/public/assets/generated"

    {
      "description": "Cloud save/load conversion logic that explicitly drops/does not sync photo unlock state (defaults unlockedPhotos to ['photo-1'] when loading from backend).",
      "reason": "BuildRequest focuses on an offline-first gallery with local persistence and does not request changes to cloud sync behavior. This adds/changes behavior in the auth/sync panel unrelated to the gallery requirements and could cause unexpected loss of unlocked photo state on cloud load.",
